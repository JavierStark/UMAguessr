## LOG:

### Day 1:

We made up teams for the back and front ends, we created the Github repository and the Trello and we started brainstorming for ideas on how to implement each of the methods and objects. After that we started to try things with Java Swing and we developed some of the first proof of concepts for the map and the clicking. We also developped an class diagram for the frontend model.

### Day 2:
The frontend team found a way to do zooming on images in the UI using Swing and found a class called Robot which could be used to do unit testing over the GUI when starting with TDD.
