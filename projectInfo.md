### Day 1:

We made up teams for the back and front ends, we created the Github repository and the Trello and we started brainstorming for ideas on how to implement each of the methods and objects. After that we started to try things with Java Swing and we developed some of the first proof of concepts for the map and the clicking. We also developped an class diagram for the frontend model.
