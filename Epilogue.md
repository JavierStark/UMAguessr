# Epilogue
We would like to do a reflection on the project and the process of creating it.

First of all, it has been the first team software project for most the members of the team,
and we have been exposed methodologies and tools that we have never used before.
We have done hands-on with Scrum, TDD, Git, Github and Trello to name a few things we had been studying 
theoreticaly during the course.

This project has been the perfect opportunity to deeply understand the importance of these tools and methodologies
and how they can help us to develop a project in a more organized and efficient way, 
despite not being 100% committed to them given our lack of experience.

During the proccess, we have learned new technologies from scratch, such as Swing (which has been quite a headache),
and SQL (as our database is implemented in PostgreSQL). And we have also faced security issues we will surely
avoid in the future, such as storing the database credentials in the public repo, which has caused our database
to be attacked and our data to be deleted on the last day of the project (that is not a joke).

Talking about tests, we have been able to understand them in a better way asking ourselves a lot of questions 
about what should and should not be tested (DB, GUI, etc.), and how to test them in cases we decided to do so.

Despite using a develop branch system or flow during the whole project (main, develop-frontend, develop-backend), 
today, last day of the project, we wanted to experience with trunk based development to see if it 
solved our constant merge conflicts. And it has been a complete success to implement a lot of changes quickly among
all the team members.
